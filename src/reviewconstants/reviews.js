He was professional and friendly and took some beautiful photos to remind us of our beautiful day. They were sent to us electronically the day after which I was not expecting and they were just amazing. We‚Äôre grateful for some nigh-time shots too, they‚Äôre beautiful. \n Thanks again Ash, you are a star üåü"

Ash has a very warm and friendly character, and managed to take so many beautiful photos of every aspect, every detail of the wedding we attended. It was so lovely that he got so involved with the whole of the wedding, not missing anything at all! He was so quick to edit the photos and to get into contact when he had them finished, it just shows how passionate he is about his work! Would highly recommend üòä`

He knows the best shots and ones you wouldn't have thought of. If you want natural pictures, he captures moments you didn't know happened. Our guest's barely noticed he was there but he missed nothing. Less than 24 hours after our wedding, we had pictures to look at. I'm not sure I can praise him enough, thank-you so very much!`

If you are looking for natural shots- Ash is the man as the way he mingled around our wedding party to get natural and personal shots was great with guest all commenting how good he was.

        On the wedding day everyone commented how friendly he was and he was never pushy or made us feel staged (we wanted it to be natural). He was happy to take any shots we asked and took many we didn‚Äôt even realise. 
        He got the photographs back to us at a super quick speed! 
        It was a pleasure to have Ash as part of our special day.
        Thank you Ash!`
